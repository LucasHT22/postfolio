My personal api requests-style website

### Why?

I was fascinated by [Annabel (phthallo)](https://github.com/phthallo)'s website(You should def check, you can check it [here](https://terminal.phthallo.com/)), I thought what do I use daily and can I do as if it were a website? That famous API test site!

The name is the POST method combined with the word portfolio.

### Why no framework?

People uses frameworks too much these days let's keep simple :)
